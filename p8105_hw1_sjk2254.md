# Problem 1

loading the needed packages

assessing the dataset help file

``` r
?early_january_weather
```

    ## starting httpd help server ... done

``` r
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)

    ## [1] 15

Information about the dataset: The s\`\`

creating the scatterplot

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Temp vs Time (Hours)")
```

saving the scatterplot

``` r
ggsave("scatter_plot_p1.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem \#2

``` r
p2_df = tibble(
     num_samp = rnorm(10),
     log_vec = num_samp > 0,
     chr_vec = c("female","female","unisex","unisex","male","male","female","male","unisex","female"),
     fct_vec = factor(chr_vec)
)
```

``` r
m_num_samp = mean(pull(p2_df, num_samp))
```

``` r
m_log_vec = mean(pull(p2_df, log_vec))
```

``` r
m_chr_vec = mean(pull(p2_df, chr_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, chr_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, fct_vec)): argument is not numeric or

the character and factor vectors didnâ€™t work

``` r
